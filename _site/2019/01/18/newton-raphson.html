    <h1>Newton Raphson</h1>
<p>18 Jan 2019</p>

<p>Suddenly I had the urge to learn the basics of Go (lang) and see
what’s so special about it. So, I went to golang and from
there I started the “<a href="https://tour.golang.org/">A Tour of Go</a>” short tutorial. It’s kind of like
an interactive tutorial. As I progressed through the tutorial, I
found a very interesting algorithm for finding the square root of a
number. It’s the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method">Newton-Raphson</a>
root-finding algorithm. I literally forgot about
it, but I learnt about this in my 5th semester’s math course.</p>

<p>I should quote one important part from the tour:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you are interested in the details of the algorithm, the z² − x
above is how far away z² is from where it needs to be (x), and the
division by 2z is the derivative of z², to scale how much we adjust z
by how quickly z² is changing. This general approach is called
Newton’s method. It works well for many functions but especially well
for square root.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> the left most numbers indicate line numbers, not output
values. First column indicates <strong>i</strong>, second column indicates standard
library’s <strong>math.Sqrt()</strong> function and the third column indicates my
hand-written <strong>Sqrt()</strong> function using the Newton-Raphson root finding
algorithm.</p>

<p>As seen from the output results, the algorithm is quite accurate even
for just <strong>10-15 iterations</strong> it gives us almost the same accuracy as
the standard library’s square root function. I think, I might start
using it for my own code instead of the C/C++ builtin sqrt() function.</p>
