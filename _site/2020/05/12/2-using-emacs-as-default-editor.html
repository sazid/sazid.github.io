    <h1>2 Using Emacs As Default Editor</h1>
<p>12 May 2020</p>

<p>I’ve learnt the basics of vim a few years ago and I’ve been able to <em>just use
it</em> whenever necessary. I felt quite comfortable in editing small config files
with vim. However, I’ve tried to use it for large codebases and everytime I
tried it, for some reason, I just couldn’t work with it properly.</p>

<p>Recently, I’ve started using linux as my daily driver again (took a break when I
started play Apex Legends on Windows :p). This time, linux seems so much more
usable to me. Gnome 3 has become quite efficient and I think it just stands out
on its own as a separate kind of desktop environment similar to OSX and
Windows. I used to dislike how slow and inefficient Gnome 3 was, that’s not the
case anymore!. Well… I still don’t like the really big title bars in gui
applications (take not from Windows &amp; OSX!). However, I love the overview screen
when you press the Super key (Windows key).</p>

<p>So, as part of the ongoing endeavour I decided to give emacs a go again (learnt
the basics once but forgot everything…). This time I’ve decided to dedicate
more time to know about the application properly. Anyway, now that I’ve decided
to dedicate my time to emacs, I’ll need to stop using vim for basic editing for
sometime, so I needed to configure the terminal default editor. In order to do
that, just put the following in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/.profile</code>.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Set emacs as the default EDITOR</span>
<span class="nv">VISUAL</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"/usr/bin/emacs -nw"</span>
<span class="nb">export </span>VISUAL
<span class="nv">EDITOR</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"/usr/bin/emacs -nw"</span>
<span class="nb">export </span>EDITOR
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That should be it! Oh btw, if you need to use the Menu bar available in emacs
terminal at the top of the window, press <code class="highlighter-rouge">F10</code>.</p>
