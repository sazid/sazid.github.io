I"5<p>Suddenly I had the urge to learn the basics of Go (lang) and see
what’s so special about it. So, I went to https://golang.org/ and from
there I started the “A Tour of Go” short tutorial. It’s kind of like
an interactive tutorial. As I progressed through the tutorial, I found
a very interesting algorithm for finding the square root of a
number. It’s the <strong>Newton-Raphson root-finding algorithm</strong>. I
literally forgot about it, but I learnt about this in my 5th
semester’s math course.
