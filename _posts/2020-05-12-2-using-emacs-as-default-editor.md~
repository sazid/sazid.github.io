I'm learnt the basics of vim a few years ago and I've been able to *just use it*
whenever necessary. I felt quite comfortable in editing small config files with
vim. However, I've tried to use it for large codebases and everytime I tried it,
for some reason, I just couldn't work with it properly. Recently, I've started
using linux as my daily driver again (took a break when I started play Apex
Legends on Windows :p). This time, linux seems so much more usable to me. Gnome
3 has become quite efficient and I think it just stands out on its own as a
separate kind of desktop environment similar to OSX and Windows (although it
borrows ideas from both of those). I used to dislike how slow and inefficient
Gnome 3 was. Well... I still don't like the really big title bars in gui
applications (take not from Windows & OSX!).
