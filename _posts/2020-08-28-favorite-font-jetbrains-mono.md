I've finally found a font that I really like. It's the [JetBrains
Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) font family. Very easy to
discern characters even when the font size is small. Previously I used
to swap between Consolas, Monaco and Roboto Mono. In fact, if the
fonts have loaded properly, you're most probably reading this
paragraph with JetBrains Mono enabled.

Thank you so much to the JetBrains team for this wonderful font and
for making it free and open source!

My usual font size is set to 14 in VS Code. Comfortable to view for me
on both my desktop and my Thinkpad x280 (ubuntu can't seem to figure
out a perfect screen scaling parameter, thus making everything look so
tiny at 100% scaling, 125% is a bit bigger for my taste, specially on
such a small screen).
