A personal list of some of the best CLI tools I've found so far
and using on a regular basis.

- `exa`          (replacement for `ls`, https://github.com/ogham/exa)
- `fd`           (replacement for `find` but more user friendly, https://github.com/sharkdp/fd)
- `bat`          (replacement for `cat` but sooo much better!, https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)
- `rg (ripgrep)` (replacement for `grep`, searches for content inside files, super fast!, https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)

All of these are written in rust, neat!
