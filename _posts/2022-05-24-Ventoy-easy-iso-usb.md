I've found this neat tool that lets me host multiple ISO files in a
single USB drive without having to flash it again and again every
time I try to install an OS. Tested for Windows 11, Fedora and
Ubuntu. Supposedly, it works with 90%+ distros out there...

This works very much like how we dual boot - I just need to copy
the ISO files I want over to the USB drive and that's it. The ISO
will show up as an option to boot into when I boot from the USB
drive.
