      <title>New Keyboard and Mouse</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using A4TECH Comfort Key Rounded Keycaps for quite sometime and I love it. The keyboard feels really smooth and the keys are very easy to press. But recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve started to play games again (that&amp;rsquo;s a topic for another post). I think I played so much that it amounted to more than 350+ hours of gameplay within 1-2 months. Anyways, as I have been playing games on this keyboard, it has started to feel clunky and I can feel the keys not being pressed properly.</description>

      <title>Rabin Karp algorithm</title>

      <description>MathJax.Hub.Config({ tex2jax: {inlineMath: [[&#39;$&#39;,&#39;$&#39;], [&#39;\\(&#39;,&#39;\\)&#39;]]} });  Rabin Karp algorithm is a string search algorithm with running time of $O(|s|+|t|)$ where $s$ is the pattern to search for and $t$ is the text in which the pattern is to be searched. It utilises a so called rolling hash to compare the strings to find matching patterns.
The idea is, instead of comparing character by character which will take $O(|s|*|t|)$ time, we utilise hashes to compare strings in $O(|s|+|t|)$ time.</description>

      <title>String Hashing</title>
      <link>https://sazid.github.io/posts/2019/01/22/string-hashing/</link>

      <description>MathJax.Hub.Config({ tex2jax: {inlineMath: [[&#39;$&#39;,&#39;$&#39;], [&#39;\\(&#39;,&#39;\\)&#39;]]} });  I&amp;rsquo;ve always wondered how c++ std::map works. Turns out its typically implemented as a Binary Search Tree (BST for short). Why a BST? The most probable answer I can come up with, is how hashing is implemented. How? Let&amp;rsquo;s see.
I&amp;rsquo;ll just go over string hashing as I don&amp;rsquo;t know the specifics about how other data types are hashed. Basically, string hashing is a process of turning any string into a unique integer that identifies only that particular string.</description>

      <description>Suddenly I had the urge to learn the basics of Go (lang) and see what&amp;rsquo;s so special about it. So, I went to https://golang.org/ and from there I started the &amp;ldquo;A Tour of Go&amp;rdquo; short tutorial. It&amp;rsquo;s kind of like an interactive tutorial. As I progressed through the tutorial, I found a very interesting algorithm for finding the square root of a number. It&amp;rsquo;s the Newton-Raphson root-finding algorithm. I literally forgot about it, but I learnt about this in my 5th semester&amp;rsquo;s math course.</description>

      <description>Problem link: https://uva.onlinejudge.org/external/2/230.pdf
ok, so I got to learn a new word mutilate: inflict serious damage.
People don&amp;rsquo;t put books back where they should and instead they are kept in the main desk, this might be a major line&amp;hellip;or maybe not, let&amp;rsquo;s continue.
Periodically, the librarians will ask your program for a list of books that have been returned so the books can be returned to their correct places on the shelves.</description>
